# access-control

The goal of this project is to provide a **access control system**.

Initially, the access system will not be taken by external devices, such as magnet cards, buttons, facial recognition etc, but who knows, maybe in the future.

The application should have a place where can be possible monitoring the log access, a form for users register and a login system.

Because the inital goal, where the log acess will not be taken by external devices, they will need be registered manually in a proper form.
